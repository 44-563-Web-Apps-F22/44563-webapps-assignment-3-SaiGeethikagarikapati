    <h2>"Jalsa"</h2>
    <p> The film shows its lead characters, two women in their 40's being both, brave and vulnerable despite all odds stacked against them. The multi-layered film probes important subjects and makes one wonder about different life choices and the consequences that come along with it.</p>
